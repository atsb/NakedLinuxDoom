# NakedLinuxDoom
Linux Doom converted to SDL2, nothing more, nothing less.

The code itself is from sdldoom 1.10, which was Linux Doom converted to SDL1.

Only things that are changed:

1. Conversion of video code to SDL2
2. Conversion of audio code to SDL2 (no music yet)
3. 64bit conversion
4. Change of typedef from boolean to dboolean

Supported Platforms:

1. macOS (universal)
2. GNU/Linux (x64/arm64)

Note: This won't play demo's from a different version (linux doom style) and also, if you are playing ultimate doom, then your doom.wad file needs to be named 'doomu.wad' as this was the traditional naming convention.
